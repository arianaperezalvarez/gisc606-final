1) What is your "dream" GIS/tech job?
My dream GIS job is to influence the youth to pursue and see themselves in higher education, and see themselves creating resourceful data like GIS. To see themselves as creators and contributors in a field that may appear so far but really it’s at hands-reach. My dream job would have room for growth, creativity, equity, support and community.

2) What GIS applications or technologies excite you most?
At the beginning of this program, I was just excited to “make maps.” Now, what excites me the most about “just making maps,” is that I know a variety of GIS technologies and applications, how they function individually and which ones to apply for best situations.

3) What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?
I would very much like to tap into my gardening and tattooing hobby. Completely two distinct hobbies, but they both bring the same sense of muse, cultivation of patience, and dedication to manifest growth.

4) What was your favorite part of the class?
My favorite part of class was Alex walking us through the labs during class time, and giving thorough explanations of why we were committing our steps.

5)What was your least favorite part of the class?
My least favorite part of the class was being hungry, sleepy and stressed all at the same time.

6) Do you have any suggestions for how the instructor could improve the class experience for future students?
The instructor has done a fantastic job at providing flexibility and opportunities for students to succeed while not contributing to the stress of workload that already exists. Appreciate the communication, grace and room for growth as GIS professionals and students.
